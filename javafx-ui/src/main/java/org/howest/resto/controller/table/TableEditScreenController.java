FIXME
    - We should be able to edit an existing table:
       - capacity (number of seats)
            - can not be larger than 6
       - talbe number
            - can not be larger than 20 (these are the max number of tables the  application should accept!)
    - Link click events
    - Create a custom viewmodel that is used for adding/editing you entity
        - You might have to create some sort of a mapper class to map your model objects to these ViewModels
            !--> DO NOT USE YOUR DOMAIN MODELS FOR THIS <--!
    - link the entity to your form via binding
    - validate your entity and use the provided error labels to show messages, make sure these are hidden at first!
    - Add item should open up the MenuItemPriceNewScreen via your MainController
    - RemoveSelected should remove the entity that is linked to the selected row in the ListView.
        - Before actually removing your entity, make sure to ask the user for confirmation!
    - A waiter is directly linked to a user, so when creating a waiter we must create both the User as well as the Waiter object in our in-memory database!
      Thus we use the fields provided in the given view to edit both the Waiter and the User model
